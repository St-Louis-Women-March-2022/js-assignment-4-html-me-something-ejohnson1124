            <h2>How the pandemic brought knitting back</h2>
            <p>
               It is very clear that the pandemic has brought many things to many people, including the resurgence of fiber arts. I had been knitting various small projects for years, but finally started on some newer bigger items during the pandemic. Working from home brought forth more time that hadn't previously been available. 
               I now had more time and energy to try new things. I also was able to discover knitwear designers that did not resemble classic knitwear, but instead was better suited for the modern knitter. The inclusion and increase of social media during this time didn't hurt either.
               One such designer was Andrea Mowry. She started a youtube segment where she anwers knitting questions, as well as, demonstrations and showing off her designs. One such object I knit after following her was her annual Rhinebeck sweater.

            I also started participating in knit a longs, one of which is by a renowned designer, Stephen West. He enjoys hosting a mystery shawl knit a long every fall. 2021 brought "Shawlography"

            I also learned to be brave by learning steeking. This is when you cut your knitted garmet, most often to make a cardigan.
