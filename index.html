            <h2>My History</h2>
            <p>I learned how to knit when I was 10 or 11 by my mom. I was inspired to learn more due to seeing my grandmother knit. If there is anyone that I can say inspired my knitting it would be her!
               Growing up, any time I was near my grandma, she was knitting. It didn't matter the time of year. She was always knitting.

            <h2>How the pandemic brought knitting back to me</h2>
            <p>
               It is very clear that the pandemic has brought many things to many people, including the resurgence of fiber arts. I had been knitting various small projects for years, but finally started on some newer bigger items during the pandemic. Working from home brought forth more time that hadn't previously been available. 
               I now had more time and energy to try new things. I also was able to discover knitwear designers that did not resemble classic knitwear, but instead was better suited for the modern knitter. The inclusion and increase of social media during this time didn't hurt either.
               One such designer was Andrea Mowry. She started a youtube segment where she anwers knitting questions, as well as, demonstrations and showing off her designs. One such object I knit after following her was her annual Rhinebeck sweater.

            <h2>More knitwear</h2>
         <p>
            I also started participating in knit a longs, one of which is by a renowned designer, Stephen West. He enjoys hosting a mystery shawl knit a long every fall. A knit a long is when you join a group of people to knit a specific item or category of items. 2021 brought "Shawlography"

            I got into knitting hats for christmas presents this past year. I knit some classic beanies, but I also branched out into different stitch patterns. My favorite was two color brioche (not to be confused with bread).

            I also learned to be brave by learning steeking. This is when you cut your knitted garmet, most often to make a cardigan.

            <h2>Knitting Tools</h2>
            <p>
               There are so many tools available in the knitting industry that make life easier for all knitters. 
               My personal favorite is a set of interchangable needles. This allows for me to have 1 set of needles, but many options for length based on the cords I have.

            <p>Another helpful tool is a twofer!  These are known as a ball winder and yarn swift! </p>
